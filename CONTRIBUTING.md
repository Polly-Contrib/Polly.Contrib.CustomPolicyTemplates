Polly.Contrib hosts contributions to the Polly project by the community.

See the main readme for how to contribute to Polly.Contrib.

We recommend using [Git-Workflow](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/wiki/Git-Workflow) for all Polly-Contrib projects, to allow project contributors and consumers alike to understand how the code in `master` and other branches of the repository relates to released code.
